extend BlogList frontend from https://fullstackopen.com/en/part5/
to add react query and context (no redux but same function)

npm run dev to run this frontend / ok
backend: (both served on http://localhost:3003/api/blogs)
npm run server here on other terminal (json server, uses routes option and routes.json to serve on api/)
npm run dev in blogListBackend (there app.use(cors())) - this uses mongodb connexion.
